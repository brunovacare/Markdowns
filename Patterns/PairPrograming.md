# Pair Programing
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

Apesar de não parecer, parece que há um estudo dizendo que diminui a quantidade de horas necessárias para fazer uma entrega: "Pair programming increases the man-hours required to deliver code compared to programmers working individually"
