 # Continuous Integration (CI)
 * Mais info [aqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
 * Is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day
 * In XP, CI was intended to be used in combination with automated unit tests written through the practices of test-driven development. Initially this was conceived of as running and passing all unit tests in the developer's local environment before committing to the mainline.
 * Later elaborations of the concept introduced build servers, which automatically ran the unit tests periodically or even after every commit and reported the results to the developers. The use of build servers (not necessarily running unit tests) had already been practised by some teams outside the XP community. Nowadays, many organisations have adopted CI without adopting all of XP.

 Podemos utilizar o Jenkins para isso, mas para mobile é recomendável utilizar o Fastlane
