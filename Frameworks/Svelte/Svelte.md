# Svelte

* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a UI framework without Virtual DOM. It's truly reactive, with faster and smaller bundles than React and others. 
* The project started by Rich Harris, a frontend developer of New York Times.  
* Similar to Vue, Svelte combines html, style and script into the same file, with `.svelte` extension. IntelliJ already provides a plugin for Svelte. 
* Instead of processing Virtual DOM during runtime to verify what has changed, Svelte "compiler" generates a tiny javascript during compilation that updates the DOM whenever something changes. 
* Although the Svelte "compiler" was written in typecsript, Svelte still provides a poor support for Typescript. You may write typescript code inside a Svelte file, but it's currently impossible to import `.ts` files into it. You may find more info about typescript integration into Svelte [here](https://dev.to/mhaecker/use-typescript-with-svelte-sapper-45n8).
