# Single SPA

* [Single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/) allows a Web Portal to be created with multiple micro-frontends and these micro-frontends can be created in almost any framework (Angular, Vue, React...).

## Root-Config

* There are several approaches on how to setup a Single SPA website. My preferred one is by using a [root-config](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/configuration) project that serves as the main portal and orchestrates all the microfrontends. There's a sample configuration [here](https://github.com/tezine/Microfrontends/tree/master/root-config) with Angular, React and Vue.
